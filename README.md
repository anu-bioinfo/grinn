# grinn
Graph database and R package for omics integration

Version: 2.1 (03 June 2015)

Description
=========
grinn is a bioinformatics platform contains an internal graph database (Neo4j), and the R package for omics studies.
grinn incorporates data from several databases including KEGG, SMPDB, HMDB, REACTOME, CheBI, UniProt and ENSEMBL.
The package allows reconstruction of different network types e.g. metabolite-protein-gene, metabolite-protein, metabolite-pathway, protein-gene, protein-pathway and gene-pathway.
grinn applies different correlation-based network analyses to estimate relationships among different omics levels independently from domain knowledge, and with the internal graph database it provides rapid integration of domain knowledge i.e. to aid annotation of unknown metabolites.
